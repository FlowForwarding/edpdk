This example describes how to minimally use edpdk using the following commonly available environment settings;

**1.  Setup 3 virtual machines running Ubuntu Server 64-bit**


    1 VM 1
    
      - This will serve as the "dumb" forwarder
      - Number of cores: 2
      - RAM: 2048
      - Number of NICs: 2 
      - All NICs are Intel e1000/82540EM
      
    2. VM 2
    
       - This will serve as the Iperf client
       - Number of NICs: 1
       
    3. VM 3
    
       - This will serve as the Iperf server
       - Number of NICs: 2
       
    4. Network Topology

       - Establish the following:
    
      10.0.0.1                  10.0.0.2    
       [VM 2] ----- [VM 1] ----- [VM 3]
    
**2.  Build and Install**


    1.  DPDK (VM 1)
    
        - Download - http://dpdk.org/browse/dpdk/snapshot/dpdk-1.5.1r1.tar.gz
        
        - Build
            - set environment variables
                - export RTE_SDK=/path/to/dpdk/
                - export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-default-linuxapp-gcc
                    
            - Use $RTE_SDK/tools/setup.sh to build & install DPDK by selecting the following options
                1. "x86_64-default-linuxapp-gcc"
                2. "Insert IGB UIO module"
                3. "Setup hugepage mappings for non-NUMA systems"
                4. "Setup hugepage mappings for non-NUMA systems"
                5. "Bind Ethernet device to IGB UIO module"
                    - Select the PCI address of the 2 NICs
                6. "Exit Script"
                
    2.  Erlang OTP (VM 1)
    
        - Build and install Erlang.
        
    3.  edpdk (VM 1)
    
        1. git clone https://github.com/shivarammysore/edpdk
        2. cd to root edpdk root folder and execute:
           - make clean && make  && make install

    4.  iperf (VM 1, VM 2)

        - sudo apt-get install iperf
       
**3. Run**

    1.  fwdr.erl (dumb forwarder in VM 1) 
    
         1. cd to edpdk/test and execute:
           - sudo erl
           - fwdr:start_edpdk().
                - starts edpdk connected process and port
           - fwdr:rule_one(0,1,1,0).
                - starts forwarding packets coming from port 0 to port 1 and vice versa
                  
    2.  Iperf agents
    
        Assuming there are no errors in #3
        
        1.  In VM 3, 
            - iperf -s
            
        2.  In VM 2,
            - iperf -c 10.0.0.2
            

Notes:

1.  There are more ways to build DPDK, but this is the easisest and less error-prone one.
2.  fwdr.erl normally spurts out its output to stdout.
3.  In this example, the tested/used hypervisor was VirtualBox
